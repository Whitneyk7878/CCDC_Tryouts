# Windows Playbooks — CCDC Tryout

Operational playbooks for the Windows track.

## Playbooks

| File | Phase | Scripts covered |
|---|---|---|
| [target-setup-playbook.md](target-setup-playbook.md) | Pre-game / provisioning | `CCDC_Windows_TargetSetup_HTTP_FTP_DNS.ps1` |
| [setup-playbook.md](setup-playbook.md) | Pre-game / initial access | The four attack SetupScripts |

> Windows RuntimeScripts are not yet written. The Linux escalation ladder (`00` → `40`) is the model to follow when they are.

## High-Level Flow

```
BEFORE competition
  1. On each Windows target: run target setup script (provisions IIS, FTP, DNS)
  2. Once you have Administrator access: run attack setup scripts
     (users → web shell → scheduled tasks → persistence)

DURING competition
  3. Attack services using runtime scripts (TBD) or manual techniques
```
